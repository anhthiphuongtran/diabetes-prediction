# Diabetes prediction with Logistics Regression

## About
* This project is about building logistics regression model to predict diabetes status in patients (positive or negative) based on their medical history and demographic information namely age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This can be useful in an attempt to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes as well as assisting healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans.

* The dataset used in this project is downloaded from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset?resource=download), consisting of 100,000 observations, each representing a patient.


## Dependencies:
1. Python v3.x is required.
2. Pandas library is required to read and handle the data.
3. Scikit-learn library is employed to encode categorical variable, split the dataset into training set and test set, implement logistics regression model, make the confusion matrix and compute the accuracy with k-fold cross validation.
4. Numpy library is also used for working with arrays.
